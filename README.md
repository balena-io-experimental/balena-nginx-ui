# balena-nginx-ui

An unused experiment for creating a UI for Balena devices.

It always seemed a little cumbersome to have to build another backend for a frontend to communicate with just to then be passed to a second backend (the supervisor). So here I used an NGINX reverse proxy to bring the Supervisor on to an open port, then used the same NGINX instance to host a UI which communicated with the supervisor on the reverse proxy port. Pros: great image size, around 15mb, Cons: security having opened the supervisor on a port, and not much room to grow. If the goal was to pursue other features like CPU usage that isnâ€™t on the Supervisor API it would be problematic. Moreover, no means of adding a useful authentication at a later date.
